# Wheat-Quality-Estimation
This project focuses on low-cost wheat quality estimation using a custom-built multi-spectral imaging system powered by Raspberry Pi 5. The system integrates optimized lighting, magnet-held trays, and diffuser arrangements to detect impurities in grain samples with improved accuracy. Hardware prototyping was complemented by hands-on learning of Raspberry Pi imaging libraries and peripheral interfacing. The final design is modular, battery-efficient, and tailored for rural scalability.
